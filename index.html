Oh hello there!
I study bioinformatics at Vilnius University and work as a sales representative at Dreamsite. Best words that describe me - hardworking and honest. 
I strive to be the best version of myself, always progress and share my insights with other colleagues, take risks when needed. My main fields of 
interest: technology and sales. Now you may think how on earth a man from an engineering background is interested in sales? To answer this tough question, 
I wanna share some funny stories about my past. Ever since I was a little kid, selling has been my passion. I still remember when I dug a hole in the backyard
of my grandma's house because I was searching for oil. Back then, my plan was to sell the oil and become rich :) This passion carried me through later stages 
in life. In high school, I had real-world sales experience. My job was to get products for my school event from one big Lithuanian food company. I still
remember that amazing feeling when I closed that deal. That was the moment I realized that I want to work in sales. So, now, this passion remains with me. 
There's certainly yet more to learn, problems to solve. And for this, I am very grateful.
