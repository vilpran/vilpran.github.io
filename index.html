title: About Me

Oh hello there!<br><be>
<br>
I'm Vilius - a guy who is interested to work in tech and has some experience in this field. Here's a quick overview of how I ended up here.
<br><br>
In contrast to many programmers, my journey with coding didn't start when I was 5 (even though I knew how to use a computer by that time). 
It all began in high school when I became obsessed with math and started to program in C++. After writing my first "hello world" program 
and learning about different programming languages, I realized that I want to deepen my knowledge in this field. 
<br> That's why I chose to study Bioinformatics - an interesting program that allows you to manipulate biological data and solve 
complex problems by using different algorithms. During my studies, I was involved in different web-based projects 
and had my first customer - a private Lithuanian clinic that asked me to develop a website. <br> During this project, 
I was more than happy with the feedback I got from my customer and, also, enjoyed the whole process of web development. That was 
the moment I realized that I want to progress in this field and pursue this career path.
<br><br>
So, now, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, problems to solve. And for this, I am very grateful.
